   rearrangements before and after presentation/learning sesssions,demo schedule, any other on the spot requirements,
   Will need a sub-set of the floating volunteers to distribute the participants into pre-defined groups based on their skills and background by Oct 3 EOD (each group should have a mixed skill type)
   Agenda Hand outs - preparation and distribution

 Group Leader volunteer type: 
 Duties:
  Deploy the sample application yourself (point of contact - Dana) / write/test scripts for server orchestration (point of contact - Iccha) and perform rigorous testing by Sept 30 EOD.
  Have a separate etherpad for issues you observed while testing each track project. Help fix/ notify the point of contact about the same, improvize by Oct 4.
  Have a working demo of the project ready on your laptop in case it is needed.
  Help prepare/improvize the hand-out to be distributed to participants with all the necessary instructions (needs to be given to each group on that day and content will depend upon Track type)
  Include all the necessary accounts that need to be created by each team member/group before the start of the project.
  Include a list of all the dependent packages that need to be installed for each Track type. 
  Include the objective , process flow , requirements , use cases 
  General workflow for participants would be creation of a github repo and then contributing to it in the course of the project. 
  Gather feedback about the session from the group - have a list of survey questions prepared for this beforehand - group leaders would need to co-ordinate and frame the feedback survey.


The volunteers would be required to assist before, during and after the event on Oct 8 from 10.30 am to 7pm. 
Hence, make sure you sign up only if you are free between those times on that day.
Send in your choice of volunteer type by Sept 26 EOD. 
If you choose to be a group leader, please include the track type you are interested in.
